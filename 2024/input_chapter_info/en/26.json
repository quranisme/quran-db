According to Ibn Abbas, Surah Ta Ha was revealed first, then Surah Al Waqiah, and then Surah Ash-Shu'araa.(<em>Ruh-ul-Ma'ani</em>, Vol. xx, p. 64). About Surah Ta Ha it is well known that it had been revealed before Hadrat Umar embraced Islam.</p><h2>Subject Matter and Topics</h2><p>The background of the Surah is that the disbelievers of Makkah were persistently refusing on various pretexts to reject the message of Islam given by the Holy Prophet. They would argue that he did not show them any signs to convince them of his Prophethood. Furthermore, they would characterize him as a poet or a sorcerer and mock his message, while ridiculing his Mission, and expressing that his followers were either a few foolish youth, salves or the poor people of Makkah, whereas, they argued, if his Mission had really some value then, the nobles and the elders would have accepted it first. The Holy Prophet was becoming wearied by his efforts to show them rationally the errors of their creeds and prove the truth of the Doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter, while the disbelievers were unyielding and rejected his advancements . This state of affairs was causing great anguish and grief to the Holy Prophet.</p><p>Such were the conditions under which this Surah was revealed. It begins with words of consolation to the Holy Prophet, implying, \"Why do you fret for their sake?If these people have not believed in you, it is not because they have not seen any Sign, but because they are obdurate. They will not listen to reason as they want to see a Sign which makes them bow their heads in humility. When this Sign was shown in due course, they will themselves realize that what was being presented to them was the Truth.\"</p><p>After this introduction, till verse 191, the same theme has been presented continuously, and it is said: \"The whole earth abounds in such Signs as can guide a seeker after truth to Reality, but the stubborn and misguided have never believed even after seeing the Signs, whether these were the Signs of the natural phenomena or the miracles of the Prophets. These wretched people have stubbornly adhered to their erroneous creeds till the Divine scourge actually overtook them.\" It is to illustrate this that the history of seven of the ancient tribes has been told, who persisted in disbelief just like the disbelievers of Makkah. In this connection, the following points have been stressed:</p><ol><li>The Signs are of two kinds:(a) Those visible signs presented in front of our eyes, that by seeing them an intelligent humble person can judge for themselves whether the message the Prophet is presenting is the Truth and (b) those which were seen by arrogant and haughty people of the Pharaoh, Noah, Ad, Thamud, Lot and Aiykah. Now it is for the disbelievers to decide which kind of the Signs they are eager to see.</li><li>The mentality of the disbeliever has been the same throughout the ages; their arguments and objections, their excuses and subterfuges for not believing have been similar and ultimately the fates that they met have also been the same. Likewise, the Prophets in every age presented the same messages, their personal character, reasoning and arguments against their opponents were the same, and they were all similarly blessed with mercy of Allah Almighty. Both these patterns of behavior and conduct are found in history, and the disbelievers could themselves see as to which respective patterns they and the Holy Prophet belonged.</li><li>Allah is All Mighty, All Powerful and All Merciful. History contains instances of His Wrath as well as of His Mercy. Now, therefore, it is for the people to decide whether they would like to deserve Allah's Mercy or His Wrath.</li><li>Lastly, the discussion has been summed up, saying \"O disbelievers, if at all you want to see the Signs, why should you insist on seeing those horrible Signs that visited the doomed communities of the past? Why don't you see the Qur'an which is being presented in your own language? Why don't you see Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and mercy) and his Companions? Can the revelations of the Qur'an be the work of a shaytan or a jinn? Does the recipient of the Qur'an appear to be a sorcerer? Are Muhammad and his Companions no different from a poet and his admirers? Why don't you give up disbelief and search your hearts for their judgment? When in your hearts you yourselves believe that the Revelations of the Qur'an have nothing in common with sorcery and poetry, then you should know that you are being cruel and unjust, and will certainly meet the doom meant for the cruel and unjust.\"</li></ol><p>;</p>"}}
