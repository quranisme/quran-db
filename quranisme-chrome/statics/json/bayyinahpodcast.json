Although Allah spoke directly to Prophet Musa (PBUH), He decided that these particular lessons will not be prescribed. They must be experienced. In their journey, Prophet Musa (PBUH) watches impatiently as the wise man, Al-Khidr, damages a ship, kills a child and builds a wall without asking for compensation.

If we are able to rise to this higher level of faith and only think of reasons why we should be grateful to Allah, especially at a time when our mind is being invaded by worries and negativity, then Allah has definitely promised that He will increase every possible avenue for good around us.

Allah reveals that the true story of Dawoud is that he was a deeply faithful prophet who always humbled himself to Allah and, despite his great power, kept going back to Allah in repentance.

Twenty-six letters will transform the depth of your engagement with Allah’s words, so start your pact with Allah this Ramadan.</p>\n<p>For thousands of hours of Quran and Arabic content, visit http://www.bayyinah.tv</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/9jkKTCyNVV8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":22,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Tafseer of Surah Muminoon – Part 17","date":"2017-06-07T11:00:47.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/0dsot4pX6S8/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/7hyDZvnM_ag/muminoon_17.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p>Tafseer of Surah Muminoon &#8211; Part 17</p>\n<p>06/07/17</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/0dsot4pX6S8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":23,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Tafseer of Surah Muminoon – Part 16","date":"2017-05-31T11:00:12.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/Dg448Hrb4Lw/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/-q_zhQeDroc/muminoon_16.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p class=\"p1\">Tafseer of Surah Muminoon &#8211; Part 16</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">05/31/17</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/Dg448Hrb4Lw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":24,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"The Right Approach to Duaa – Khutbah by Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-05-26T12:00:20.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/nn7qevFx97Y/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/o4SjECNmiFM/35_The%20Right%20Approach%20to%20Duaa%20-%20Khutbah%20by%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p>This Khutbah was recorded in Flower Mound on 03/17/2017.</p>\n<p>The power of duaa can&#8217;t be overstated.

A root cause of some of our serious sins is jealousy and envy. It is what drove iblis out of Allah’s grace and what led Cain to kill Abel. Jealousy and envy must not be underestimated and always entail a twisted desire to see others fail. They often creep up on you and affect every sphere of your life. When you’re jealous, it is impossible to be grateful to Allah because you’re always thinking about what you don’t have.

While our obligations to Allah are clear and simple, with the only possibility of wrong-doing falling on us, human relationships are much more complicated. But the two are not separate from each other; if you fail in your responsibilities towards people, then you have also failed before Allah. Marital relationships are a case in point. Allah perfectly sums up the husband-wife connection in the first part of Aya 34 of Surat An-Nisaa: “Arrijaal qawwamuna ‘ala an-nisaa.&#8221; Despite popular misconception, the word “qawwamuna” has nothing to do with authority, says Khan.

But the two are not separate from each other; if you fail in your responsibilities towards people, then you have also failed before Allah. Marital relationships are a case in point. Allah perfectly sums up the husband-wife connection in the first part of Aya 34 of Surat An-Nisaa: “Arrijaal qawwamuna ‘ala an-nisaa.&#8221; Despite popular misconception, the word “qawwamuna” has nothing to do with authority, says Khan.

This Madani surah was revealed after the morale-boosting pre-emptive attack and victory of the Muslims over Bani Mustalaq, a tribe that had planned to storm Madina following the Muslims’ defeat in Uhud. When the daughter of the tribe&#8217;s leader, who was taken prisoner along with over 100 others, accepts Islam, Prophet Muhammad marries her and as a gift, releases all the POWs which leads to the entire tribe accepting Islam. Upon their return, when an argument between a member of the Muhajirun and one of the Ansar threatens a bigger conflict between both groups, Prophet Muhammad urges both sides to let the incident pass and refuses to authorize the assassination of Madina’s most notorious hypocrite Abdullah Bin Obai Bin Salul, who seized the opportunity to fuel the fire and sow divisions between the two groups. When the surah was revealed, with all tenderness and care, Prophet Muhammad first recited it to 11-year-old Zeid Ibn Al-Arqam, who had recounted to the Prophet and his companions that Bin Salul had insulted the Muhajirun and helped the Muslims avert an internal conflict. In its core, Khan sums up, the theme of the softness of the heart binds the whole incident together: letting the prisoners of war go, urging the Muhajirun and Ansar to let the incident pass, dismissing Bin Salul and ignoring his lies, trusting the child and caring for his emotions. Clean intentions and sincerity to Allah are the key take-aways from this story.</p>\n<p>For more videos like this, visit https://bayyinah.tv</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/b2dqK32NjUE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":69,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"GET TO KNOW- Ep. 12 – Surah Al-Hadid – Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-01-31T15:00:33.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/eoaySJD9F1I/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/FRryO51nD-Q/GET%20TO%20KNOW-%20Ep.%2012%20-%20Surah%20Al-Hadid%20-%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p>Sponsored by Zakat Foundation of America</p>\n<p>Get to know one of the first surahs revealed in Madinah in which Allah rejuvenates the faith of the Muslim community at a time when they were feeling weak.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/eoaySJD9F1I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":70,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Surat Al-Baqarah – Part 57 – Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-01-29T14:00:39.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/AamfBG5YG8k/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/YZyFtdC8xv0/Surat%20Al-Baqarah%20-%20Part%2057%20-%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p><strong>Ayah 152-158</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In his exhaustive study of Surat Al-Baqarah, Nouman Ali Khan reflects on the second and longest chapter of the Quran.

In the version of the story of Adam revealed in Surat Al-Aaraf, Allah focuses on shaytan’s method and motivations. When he kept on whispering repeatedly in their ear, his goal was not simply to have them eat from the tree, it was to expose them “to what was unknown to them from the ugliness of their bodies.” He convinced them that if they ate from the tree they will either become angels or become immortal in janna, but once they succumbed, their covering was removed. This is shyatan’s trap; to make us celebrate shamelessness. He is not in a hurry to get us to sin or disbelieve, on the contrary, as Allah describes, he ropes us in slowly with pride and deception the way you pull up a bucket of water from a well. He will come at you with innocent things until everything that Allah had moulded in beauty, whether physically, morally or spiritually, becomes repugnant. The lesson here is that when we act outside the command of Allah, we will lose our shame in eye, speech and actions. What was beautiful will become ugly and vice versa, but all we must do avert falling deeper into sin is pray and repent.</p>\n<p>http://bayyinah.tv &#8211; For thousands of hours of Quran and Arabic content.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/1pH-HeuWDBI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":72,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Tafseer of Surah Muminoon – Part 6","date":"2017-01-25T11:00:28.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/O6hlnXXJ5nU/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/cpypvH4tEb0/muminoon_6.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p>Tafseer of Surah Muminoon &#8211; Part 6</p>\n<p>01/25/17</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/O6hlnXXJ5nU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":73,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"GET TO KNOW- Ep. 11 – Surah Ar-Rahman – Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-01-24T16:00:33.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/VyGCtmc8QEw/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/b_QOxMWp5U4/GET%20TO%20KNOW-%20Ep.%2011%20-%20Surah%20Ar-Rahman%20-%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p>Sponsored by Zakat Foundation of America</p>\n<p>Get to know one of the most beautiful surahs in the Quran with the most repeated phrase &#8216;and what of the favors, wonders and gifts from your Lord will you be in denial of?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/VyGCtmc8QEw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":74,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Surat Al-Baqarah – Part 56 – Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-01-22T14:00:39.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/BXSUg71TyRw/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/M0MnaMFfh8I/Surat%20Al-Baqarah%20-%20Part%2056%20-%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p><strong>Ayah 145-151</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In his exhaustive study of Surat Al-Baqarah, Nouman Ali Khan reflects on the second and longest chapter of the Quran.

Cults are by definition groups of people who live on the fringes of society, ideologically at war with “others”, are antagonistic, command uniformity, feed off negative emotions, have no tolerance for dialogue and perpetuate practices even without knowing why they’re doing them. On the contrary, a community keeps its doors open, accepts diversity, thrives on encouragement and trust and adapts when times and needs change. Often in churches, synagogues and even mosques we think of ourselves as communities but we behave as cults, excluding others following different schools of thought and behaving self-righteously. In Surat Al-Baqarah, Allah describes how on the day of judgment those who set the trends and standards which others had followed mindlessly would cut themselves off from those who followed them, and those who followed would say that if they had a second chance, they too would cut themselves off from those fake idols. Khan concludes that the Muslim Ummah is based on one thing only: Taqwa, consciousness of Allah and an unequivocal belief in His oneness. When we create fake uniforms, we place unreasonable pressures on ourselves and our social circles and end up losing members of our community, perhaps irreversibly.</p>\n<p>For thousands of hours of Quran and Arabic content, visit http://www.bayyinah.tv</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/BOo9I99ovAg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":76,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Tafseer of Surah Muminoon – Part 5","date":"2017-01-18T11:00:02.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/ENA2UO5udnY/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/jtO4xoT4WnE/muminoon_5.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p class=\"p1\">Tafseer of Surah Muminoon &#8211; Part 5</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">01/18/17</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/ENA2UO5udnY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":77,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"GET TO KNOW- Ep. 10 – Surah Al-Hujurat – Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-01-17T16:00:33.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/u3G8b2N5XgA/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/ks7MUNsgMmU/GET%20TO%20KNOW-%20Ep.%2010%20-%20Surah%20Al-Hujurat%20-%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p>Sponsored by Zakat Foundation of America</p>\n<p>Get to know the surah that details how we should honor the Prophet ﷺ, how we should honor one another as brothers and sisters in faith and how our honor with Allah has nothing to do with tribe, race or skin color; but has everything to do with taqwa and piety.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~4/u3G8b2N5XgA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":78,"radio_ustad":"Bayyinah Institute","name":"Surat Al-Baqarah – Part 55 – Nouman Ali Khan","date":"2017-01-15T14:00:39.000Z","radio_link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~3/Wyy4uGIABZw/","radio_url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BayyinahPodcast/~5/AQ0X0qaCKSE/Surat%20Al-Baqarah%20-%20Part%2055%20-%20Nouman%20Ali%20Khan.mp3","duration":"","viewed":"","kajian_description":"<p><strong>Ayah 143-144</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In his exhaustive study of Surat Al-Baqarah, Nouman Ali Khan reflects on the second and longest chapter of the Quran.

While adulterers must be whipped 100 times, it is only on condition that four witnesses see them commit this public display of indecency, which is criminalized by all societies. The verses also mete out an almost equal punishment to those who so much as hint that a woman has committed adultery without seeing the sin being committed with their own eyes.
