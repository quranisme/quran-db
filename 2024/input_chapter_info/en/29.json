Some commentators have opined that since it mentions the hypocrites, and hypocrisy appeared in Madinah, the first ten verses of this Surah were revealed at Madinah and the rest of it at Makkah; whereas the people whose hypocrisy has been mentioned here are those who had adopted a hypocritical way of life because they were afraid of the oppression and extreme physical torture to which the Muslims were being subjected by the disbelievers. Evidently, this kind of hypocrisy could be there only at Makkah and not at Madinah. Similarly, some other commentators, seeing that in this Surah the Muslims have been exhorted to migrate, have regarded it as the last Surah to be revealed at Makkah, whereas the Muslims had migrated to Habash even before their migration to Madinah. These opinions are not based on any tradition but on the internal evidence of the subject matter, and this internal evidence, when considered against the subject matter of the Surah as a whole, points to the conditions prevailing at the time of the migration to Habash and not to the last stage at Makkah.</p><h2>Theme and Subject matter</h2><p>A close examination of the Surah shows that the period of its revelation occurred at a time of extreme persecution of the Muslims in Makkah. The disbelievers were opposing and fighting Islam vehemently, and new converts were being subjected to severe oppression. It was under such conditions that Allah sent down this Surah to strengthen and encourage the sincere Muslims as well as to put to shame those who were showing weakness of the faith. Besides, the disbelievers of Makkah have been threatened and warned not to invite for themselves the fate that the antagonists of the Truth have been experiencing in every age.</p><p>The disbelievers were urging their offsprings to abandon Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him), and return to their ancestral religion, for they argued: \"The Qur'an in which you have put your faith, regards the rights of the parents as the uppermost; therefore, listen to what we say; otherwise you will be working against the dictates of your own Faith.\" This has been answered in <a href=\"/29/8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">verse 8</a>.</p><p>Similarly, people of some clans said to the new converts to Islam, \"Leave the question of punishments, etc., to us. Listen to us and abandon this man. If God seizes you in the Hereafter, we will come forward and say, 'Lord, these people are innocent: we had forced them to give up the Faith; therefore, seize us'.\" This has been dealt with, in <a href=\"/29/12-13\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vv. 12-13</a>.</p><p>The stories mentioned in this Surah also impress the same point mostly, as if to say, \"Look at the Prophets of the past: they were made to suffer great hardships and were treated cruelly for long periods. Then, at last they were helped by Allah. Therefore, take heart: Allah's help will certainly come but a period of trial and tribulation has to be undergone.\" Besides teaching this lesson to the Muslims, the disbelievers also have been warned, as if to say, \"If you are not being immediately seized by Allah, you should not form the wrong impression that you will never be seized. The signs of the doomed nations of the past are before you. Just see how they met their doom and how Allah helped the Prophets.\"</p><p>The Muslims were instructed to the effect: \"If you feel that the persecution has become unbearable for you, you should give up your homes, instead of giving up your Faith: Allah's earth is vast: seek a new place where you can worship Allah with the full peace of mind.\" Besides all this, the disbelievers also have been urged to understand Islam. The realities of <em>Tauhid</em> and the Hereafter have been impressed with rational arguments, <em>shirk</em> has been refuted, and drawing their attention towards the signs of the universe, they have been told that all these Signs confirm the teachings that the Prophet is presenting before them.</p>"}}
