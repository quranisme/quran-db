This is merely to distinguish it from other Surahs.</p>\r\n<h2>Period of Revelation</h2>\r\n<p>The following internal evidence shows that this Surah was revealed during the last Makkan stage of Prophethood:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p><a href=/16/41>41</a> clearly shows that persecution had forced some Muslims to emigrate to Habash before the revelation of this Surah.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>It is evident from <a href=/16/106>v. 106</a> that at that time the persecution of the Muslims was at its height. Therefore a problem had arisen in regard to the utterance of a blasphemous word, without actual disbelief, under unbearable conditions. The problem was that if one did so how he should be treated.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p><a href=/16/112-114>vv. 112-114</a> clearly refer to the end of seven year famine that had struck Makkah some years after the appointment of the Holy Prophet as Allah's Messenger.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>There is a reference to <a href=/16/116>v. 116</a> of this Surah in VI: 145, and v. 118 of this Surah contains a reference to VI: 146. This is a proof that both these Surahs (VI and XVI) were sent down in the same period.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The general style of the Surah also supports the view that this was revealed during the last stage at Makkah.</p>\r\n<h2>Central Theme</h2>\r\n<p>All the topics of the Surah revolve round different aspects of the Message, ie., refutation of <em>shirk</em>, proof of <em>Tauhid</em>, and warning of the consequences of the rejection of and opposition and antagonism to the Message.</p>\r\n<h2>Topics of Discussion</h2>\r\n<p>The very first verse gives direct and strict warning to those who were rejecting the Message outright, as if to say, \"Allah's decision has already been made concerning your rejection of the Message. Why are you then clamoring for hastening it? Why don't you make use of the respite that is being given to you!\" And this was exactly what the disbelievers of Makkah needed at the time of the revelation of this Surah. For they challenged the Holy Prophet over and over again: \"Why don't you bring that scourge with which you have been threatening us! For we have not only rejected your Message but have been openly opposing it for a long time.\" Such a challenge had become a by-word with them, which they frequently repeated as a clear proof that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was not a true Prophet.</p>\r\n<p>Immediately after this warning they have been admonished to give up <em>shirk</em>, for this false creed was the main obstacle in the way of the Message. Then the following topics come over and over again, one after the other:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Very convincing proofs of <em>Tauhid</em> and refutation of <em>shirk</em> have been based on the plain signs in the universe and in man's own self.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The objections of the disbelievers have been answered, their arguments refuted, their doubts removed and their false pretexts exposed.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Warnings have given of the consequences of persistence in false ways and antagonism to the Message.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The moral changes which the Message of the Holy Prophet aims to bring practically in human life have been presented briefly in an appealing manner. The <em>mushriks</em> have been told that belief in Allah, which they also professed, demanded that it should not be confined merely to lip service, but this creed should take a definite shape in moral and practical life.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The Holy Prophet and his companions have been comforted and told about the attitude they should adopt in the face of antagonism and persecution by the disbelievers.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>;\r\n"}}
