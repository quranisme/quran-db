A whole world of meaning has been compressed into its few brief words, which is too vast in content to be fully expressed even in a book. In the surah, in a clear and plain way, the way to true success for man and the way to ruin and destruction for him have both been stated. Imam Ash Shafi'i has very rightly said that if the people only considered this Surah well, it alone would suffice them for their guidance. How important this Surah was in the sight of the Companions can be judged from the tradition cited from Hadrat Abdullah bin Hisn ad-Darimi Abu Madinah, according to which whenever any two of them met, they would not part company until they had recited Surah Al-Asr to each other.
